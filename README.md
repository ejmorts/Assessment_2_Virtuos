# Welcome to Virtuos a Virtual Reality Training Program

## Personal Information

### Elliott Morton
My name is Elliott Morton, I’m currently studying an Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT, and my student number is s3795102. My hobbies include; Virtual Reality gaming, Cricket, Travelling and watching the beautiful game that is Football aka soccer. At the end of my studies I’d love to work in either sports statistics and analytics or Game Design specifically for Virtual Reality, to achieve either of these jobs in the future I will have to complete a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology and also a Graduate Certificate in Sports Analytics.

### Duc Tran
My name is Duc Tran (student I.D s3807447) and currently I am doing 3 subjects which are user-centred design, introduction to programming and introduction to information and technology. Outside of I.T I am currently working at a bakery, like to exercise, watch anime and collect rocks. I hope to one day work somewhere in the data analytics field but I am still open to other options. My interest in I.T began when I was little through my oldest brother who at the time was working for IBM. I was always interested in what he was doing both hardware and software wise. As the years progressed I started to delve more into programming such as making a website in year 10 using Microsoft Front Page and then moving on to java coding using C++, using Microsoft SQL for making databases, using Python and finally to Eclipse. The team I am a part of is named Virtuos.

When taking the results of figures 2 to 7 and Chiho’s tests into account when forming a team, these results tells us what the personality of each member is like and what their method of learning is, and so would help us understand how each member of the team is like from their personality to their preference of learning style. From knowing this, this could potentially help us form a team that is more understanding of each other and help us work together better. For example, if all members have a strong desire to do well in their given tasks then overall the team has a higher probability of obtaining higher marks for the project.

### Chiho's Test Results
Chiho underwent three tests which were the Myers-Briggs test, the online learning test and the DISC (Dominance Influence Steadiness and Conscientiousness) test. Her Myers-Briggs test result came back as Introverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving (ISFP-T) (Yamagishi 2019). The result of her learning style test revealed that she was a visual type of learner and lastly her DIS personality test results revealed that she was conscientious, diligent and has attention to detail (Yamagishi 2019).

## Ideal Jobs
The ideal job for Duc would be as a data analyst, Chiho’s ideal job would be as a financial advisor and Elliot’s ideal job would be as a sports performance analyst. These jobs are all jobs that require analytical skills in order to identify the problem and solve it. As a data analyst we would need to figure out and look thoroughly at the raw data and translate that into a format that is understandable by key stakeholders. As a financial advisor we would need to analyse the client’s situation, plan and research the best way to make use of the available finances to them. Finally as a sports performance analyst we would need to analyse the athlete’s performance and formulate a plan that they can follow to better improve themselves.

Each of our dream jobs differ from each other by the fact that they are in different job fields although as a data analyst I could be working with clients from both Chiho’s and Elliot’s field. Chiho’s dream job would be more in the finance field, Elliot’s dream job would be in the sports field and my dream job would be in the statistical and data processing field. Each field would have a different emphasise on the skill sets one must have to work in the job and the types of clients one will meet in their job.

# Project Idea - Virtuos (VR Training)
The scale of the employment challenge is vast and in a fast paced ever changing world. The International Labour Organization estimates that more than 61 million jobs have been lost since the start of the global economic crisis in 2008, leaving more than 200 million people unemployed globally. Technology is going to drive businesses into the future and engaging and training employees. 

Virtual Reality (VR) is a three-dimensional, computer-generated representation of physical worlds. These worlds are immersive, and users can interact with them as if they are real. A variety of VR devices are available on the market, ranging from inexpensive cardboard-based devices that work with a smartphone to expensive, professional-grade headsets.

The use of virtual reality as a training tool is well known, in the field of surgery. Medical schools have adopted this technology as a way of teaching the next generation of surgeons, for example robotic surgery. Training is necessary to ensure that people can perform their jobs or learn a subject in order to be fully productive. But the costs can be expensive, for example, developing a series of prototypes. Virtual Reality removes the needs for repeated prototyping and/or implementation which we know can be costly. What it does instead is to replace this with a single model which can be used time and time again. Plus, it can be accessed from different locations which will inevitably save time and money.

Virtual Reality can be used as a virtual education and employment tool to reskill and retrain employees and for people who speak English as a second language or for people who come from high unemployment and low education areas. This technology will make learning easy for people who don’t speak English as their first language as the VR itself can be used in several different languages. For people from low education areas VR training will be able to provide realistic scenarios for learning whilst also making the experience pleasant and enjoyable which means that there is a higher level of engagement and understanding. VR is suitable for different learning styles because it enables self-paced learning in a realistic environment at anytime and anywhere. 

This technology will allow workers to use virtual environments to create radical new solutions to problems or upgrades to existing services or products. Using scenario-based learning VR is known to enhance critical thinking and real-world decision making. By integrating immersive, 360-degree video into scenario-based training, the experience is more resonant and realistic, which will help people to retain what they have learnt. 
Virtual Reality is poised to be a breakthrough technology for training, thanks to its immersive nature and the freedom it offers to practice in realistic settings without worrying about outcomes.
