# Welcome to Virtuos a Virtual Reality Training Program

## Personal Information

### Elliott Morton
My name is Elliott Morton, I’m currently studying an Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT, and my student number is s3795102. My hobbies include; Virtual Reality gaming, Cricket, Travelling and watching the beautiful game that is Football aka soccer. At the end of my studies I’d love to work in either sports statistics and analytics or Game Design specifically for Virtual Reality, to achieve either of these jobs in the future I will have to complete a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology and also a Graduate Certificate in Sports Analytics.

### Duc Tran
My name is Duc Tran (student I.D s3807447) and currently I am doing 3 subjects which are user-centred design, introduction to programming and introduction to information and technology. Outside of I.T I am currently working at a bakery, like to exercise, watch anime and collect rocks. I hope to one day work somewhere in the data analytics field but I am still open to other options. My interest in I.T began when I was little through my oldest brother who at the time was working for IBM. I was always interested in what he was doing both hardware and software wise. As the years progressed I started to delve more into programming such as making a website in year 10 using Microsoft Front Page and then moving on to java coding using C++, using Microsoft SQL for making databases, using Python and finally to Eclipse. The team I am a part of is named Virtuos.

### Chiho Yamagishi
My name is Chiho Yamagishi and my student number is S3570265. I am Japanese from the city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo. I like travelling and have always liked studying English and wanted to be able to fluently speak English, which led me to the U.K. to study. Luckily, after this, I got the opportunity to work for a company in the U.K and stayed there for 6 years. After this I moved and now live in Australia. I have worked as an administrator in several companies in Japan, U.K and Australia. At weekends, I enjoy relaxing playing with my kids. When time allows, I also enjoy making ceramics. In terms of I.T. interest, I have always been a user of computers and interested in new technologies, however, I have never worked In I.T. department. I am doing this course as a part of Financial Planning degree. I look forward to learning something new from this course, although I am not going down an I.T. path, I believe it will be beneficial to my daily work.

### Figure 6

When taking the results of figures 2 to 7 and Chiho’s tests into account when forming a team, these results tells us what the personality of each member is like and what their method of learning is, and so would help us understand how each member of the team is like from their personality to their preference of learning style. From knowing this, this could potentially help us form a team that is more understanding of each other and help us work together better. For example, if all members have a strong desire to do well in their given tasks then overall the team has a higher probability of obtaining higher marks for the project.

### Figure 9

Chiho underwent three tests which were the Myers-Briggs test, the online learning test and the DISC (Dominance Influence Steadiness and Conscientiousness) test. Her Myers-Briggs test result came back as Introverted Sensing Feeling Perceiving (ISFP-T) (Yamagishi 2019). The result of her learning style test revealed that she was a visual type of learner and lastly her DIS personality test results revealed that she was conscientious, diligent and has attention to detail (Yamagishi 2019).

## Ideal Jobs
The ideal job for Duc would be as a data analyst, Chiho’s ideal job would be as a financial advisor and Elliot’s ideal job would be as a sports performance analyst. These jobs are all jobs that require analytical skills in order to identify the problem and solve it. As a data analyst we would need to figure out and look thoroughly at the raw data and translate that into a format that is understandable by key stakeholders. As a financial advisor we would need to analyse the client’s situation, plan and research the best way to make use of the available finances to them. Finally as a sports performance analyst we would need to analyse the athlete’s performance and formulate a plan that they can follow to better improve themselves.

Each of our dream jobs differ from each other by the fact that they are in different job fields although as a data analyst I could be working with clients from both Chiho’s and Elliot’s field. Chiho’s dream job would be more in the finance field, Elliot’s dream job would be in the sports field and my dream job would be in the statistical and data processing field. Each field would have a different emphasise on the skill sets one must have to work in the job and the types of clients one will meet in their job.
